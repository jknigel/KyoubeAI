Usage: ./update.sh [options]

  (no option)         Update to the newest release, after a backup
  --version <x.y.z>   Update to this release (never older than the current one)
  --rollback          Go back to the release and data from before the last update
  --edge              Follow the current branch: git pull and rebuild from source
  --yes               Answer yes to every question

An update that stopped before it finished is continued by running the same
command again (no second backup); --rollback undoes it instead. A rollback
that stopped part way is finished with ./update.sh --rollback. Without a
terminal, --rollback needs --yes.
