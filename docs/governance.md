# Access governance for agents

Two independent gates decide whether an agent's call to a Kyoube tool actually does anything. Get
both right before you hand an agent broad tool access:

1. **Kyoube's own grant levels** (`none < read < write < schema`) decide whether the *plugin worker*
   accepts the call at all, for that company. This is enforced inside `kyoube.apps` on every request —
   there is no way around it from inside a tool call, and it is the same check whether the caller is a
   person on the Data page or an agent using `kyoube.apps:data_*`/`kyoube.apps:apps_*`.
2. **The core's (Paperclip's) tool profiles and policies** decide whether the agent's *tool call* is even allowed to
   reach the plugin, and whether it needs a human's sign-off first. This is the core's own MCP Access
   Governance layer — full reference in upstream's
   [`doc/MCP-ACCESS-GOVERNANCE.md`](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/main/doc/MCP-ACCESS-GOVERNANCE.md).
   As that document puts it: **a profile decides *can this agent see the tool*; a policy decides *is
   this exact call allowed right now***.

**Which gate applies depends on how the agent reaches Kyoube.** The core's profiles and policies govern
tool calls that pass through its MCP gateway, and the core (2026.831.1 through 2026.916.1) only gives a run that gateway
when the agent already has an installed MCP connection (see `architecture.md`, "Agent run → Kyoube").
The managed skills therefore lead with Kyoube's REST routes, which every run can call with its own
`PAPERCLIP_API_KEY` — and a REST call is checked by gate 1 only. If you want gate 2 as well (an
approval on `data_drop_table`, say), connect an MCP server to the company so that its agents receive
the gateway, and the `kyoube.apps:*` tools with it; until then, the agent's Kyoube grant level is the
whole story, so grant `schema` only to the agent you would let drop a table.

The two are complementary, not redundant. Kyoube's grant level is the guarantee that holds even if a
profile is misconfigured — an agent at `none` cannot write a row no matter what the core lets it call.
The core's profiles and policies are the guardrail you can tighten *without touching the plugin*: they
run before the call ever reaches `kyoube.apps`, they can force human approval for a specific dangerous
tool regardless of the agent's own data-access grant, and they are what gives you a per-tool audit trail
of every attempted call, allowed or not (`GET /api/tool-gateway/audit`).

The recipe below builds a company profile that only exposes Kyoube's read tools by default, a policy
that forces human approval for the three most consequential write calls, and a rate limit on bulk
inserts. All three examples use the tool names exactly as the host namespaces them:
`kyoube.apps:data_*` and `kyoube.apps:apps_*` (the core's plugin tools are namespaced
`<pluginId>:<toolName>`).

Every command needs `$KYOUBE_URL` (the core's base URL), `$BOARD_API_KEY` (an instance-admin key —
see [`docs/operations.md`](operations.md#rotating-the-board-api-key)), and `$COMPANY_ID`.

## 1. A read-only default profile

Create a profile that includes only Kyoube's read-level tools — `data_list_tables`,
`data_describe_table`, `data_query`, `data_get`, `data_count`, and `data_sql_select` — matched by
`selectorType: "tool_name"`, one exact name per entry (kept explicit rather than a single wildcard
pattern, so the profile does exactly what it says regardless of how a given core version matches a
glob):

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOARD_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$KYOUBE_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/tools/profiles" \
  -d '{
    "profileKey": "kyoube.safe-default",
    "name": "Kyoube safe default (read-only)",
    "defaultAction": "deny",
    "entries": [
      { "selectorType": "tool_name", "toolName": "kyoube.apps:data_list_tables", "effect": "include" },
      { "selectorType": "tool_name", "toolName": "kyoube.apps:data_describe_table", "effect": "include" },
      { "selectorType": "tool_name", "toolName": "kyoube.apps:data_query", "effect": "include" },
      { "selectorType": "tool_name", "toolName": "kyoube.apps:data_get", "effect": "include" },
      { "selectorType": "tool_name", "toolName": "kyoube.apps:data_count", "effect": "include" },
      { "selectorType": "tool_name", "toolName": "kyoube.apps:data_sql_select", "effect": "include" }
    ]
  }' | jq '{id, name, defaultAction}'
```

(Upstream's own `doc/MCP-ACCESS-GOVERNANCE.md` example uses `selectorValue` for a profile entry — that
field doesn't exist on `createToolProfileEntrySchema`; the field a `tool_name` entry actually takes is
`toolName`, as above, and a `risk_level` entry takes `riskLevel`.)

Bind it as the company's default so every agent that has no narrower binding gets it:

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOARD_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$KYOUBE_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/tools/profiles/$PROFILE_ID/bind" \
  -d '{ "targetType": "company", "targetId": "'"$COMPANY_ID"'", "priority": 100 }' | jq .
```

An agent that genuinely needs to write rows or change schema needs its **own** profile bound at
`targetType: "agent"` (narrower scopes win) that also includes the write/schema tools it needs — this
default only covers the common case of an agent that should merely read and report.

## 2. Require human approval for the dangerous calls

`data_drop_table` and `data_remove_field` destroy data (recoverable for 30 days, but still); `apps_publish`
is the one gate between a prompt-injected agent and a running app that other people will open. Force
approval on all three regardless of which profile let the call through:

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOARD_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$KYOUBE_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/tools/policies" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Kyoube: approve destructive schema changes and publishes",
    "policyType": "require_approval",
    "priority": 10,
    "selectors": {
      "toolNames": ["kyoube.apps:data_drop_table", "kyoube.apps:data_remove_field", "kyoube.apps:apps_publish"]
    }
  }' | jq '{id, name, policyType, priority}'
```

A matching call now comes back `409` with `reasonCode: "approval_required"` and an `actionRequestId`;
the agent's run pauses on that call until a human approves or rejects it in the UI (or via
`POST /api/tool-gateway/action-requests/:id/approve`). See upstream's
[Approval flow and trust rules](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/blob/main/doc/MCP-ACCESS-GOVERNANCE.md#approval-flow-and-trust-rules)
for promoting a repeated, reviewed approval into a standing trust rule.

## 3. Rate-limit bulk writes

`data_insert` takes up to 500 rows per call already, but nothing stops an agent from calling it in a
loop. A `rate_limit` policy adds a ceiling on top of Kyoube's own per-call cap, keyed per agent so one
runaway agent doesn't exhaust the whole company's budget:

```sh
curl -fsS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOARD_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$KYOUBE_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/tools/policies" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Kyoube: rate-limit bulk inserts",
    "policyType": "rate_limit",
    "priority": 20,
    "selectors": { "toolNames": ["kyoube.apps:data_insert"] },
    "config": { "rateLimit": { "limit": 100, "windowSeconds": 3600, "keyBy": ["agent"] } }
  }' | jq '{id, name, policyType, config}'
```

That allows 100 `data_insert` calls per agent per rolling hour (up to 500 rows each); a call past the
limit comes back as `rate_limited` rather than reaching the plugin. Adjust `limit`/`windowSeconds` to
the company's real bulk-load needs.

## Check what actually applies

Dry-run any of the above against a real tool call before trusting it, and check what an agent's
effective profile resolves to:

```sh
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOARD_API_KEY" \
  "$KYOUBE_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/tools/profiles/effective/agents/$AGENT_ID" \
  | jq '{profileIds, allowedToolNames}'

curl -fsS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOARD_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$KYOUBE_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/tools/policy/test" \
  -d '{
    "companyId": "'"$COMPANY_ID"'",
    "actor": { "actorType": "agent", "actorId": "'"$AGENT_ID"'", "agentId": "'"$AGENT_ID"'" },
    "request": { "toolName": "kyoube.apps:data_drop_table", "arguments": { "table": "contacts" } }
  }' | jq '{decision: .decision.decision, matchedPolicyIds: .decision.matchedPolicyIds, reasonCode: .decision.reasonCode}'
```

Every attempted call — allowed, denied, rate-limited, or sent to approval — lands in the audit log:
`GET /api/tool-gateway/audit?companyId=$COMPANY_ID&limit=100`.

## Recommended defaults

| Who | Kyoube data-access grant | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Agents, by default | `none` | Company default under **Company Settings → Data access**; grant explicitly per agent from there. |
| A "builder" agent that designs schema and ships apps | `schema` | In a dedicated project, not the company's main one, and only for the duration of the build — drop it back down (or to `write`) once the app is published and stable. |
| A "reviewer" or reporting agent | `read` | Enough to query and describe tables, never to change them. |

Layer the core's profiles and policies on top of whatever grant you choose — a `schema`-level agent
gated behind `require_approval` on its destructive calls is safer than either control alone, and both
recommendations above hold regardless of company size: the two builder/reviewer roles are exactly the
two agent shapes covered by [step 1](#1-a-read-only-default-profile) (reviewer) and a narrower,
per-agent profile that adds the write/schema tools (builder).
