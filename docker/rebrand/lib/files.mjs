/**
 * The file set the transform touches: served UI, the server's dist output, the
 * whole `packages` workspace, the skills agents read, the CLI, shipped docs.
 * Text files only; `node_modules` and anything under a `bin` directory are
 * never entered.
 *
 * `packages/**` is admitted whole — not just `packages/*_/dist` — because the
 * image's CMD is `node --import tsx/dist/loader.mjs server/dist/index.js`: tsx
 * resolves every `@paperclipai/*` workspace import through each package's
 * `exports` map, which points at `./src/*.ts`. The TypeScript sources under
 * `packages/**\/src` are the live code (several packages ship no `dist` at
 * all), so agent prompts, adapter config labels and log prefixes all live
 * there. Code files under `packages` go through `rewriteCode`, which applies
 * the generic name rule only in display context so a lucide `import
 * { Paperclip }` or a `<Paperclip/>` element is never renamed.
 *
 * Two file kinds are admitted for reasons of their own:
 * - `packages/plugins/**` sources, because `GET /api/plugins/examples` serves
 *   the example plugins' `package.json` and `src/manifest.ts` `description`
 *   strings verbatim to Settings → Plugins.
 * - the scripts the skills ship (`.sh`, `.py`, `.js`, `.mjs`), because the
 *   usage text an agent runs them for is user-facing.
 *
 * `.sql` is deliberately absent: `packages/db/src/client.ts` resolves which
 * migrations are already applied by hashing the migration files and matching
 * those hashes against `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` (`loadAppliedMigrations`),
 * so editing a shipped migration would make an upgraded install believe it is
 * pending. See docs/branding.md's residual record.

 * Trees (and a few single files) the build-time sweep is allowed to find the

 * `ghcr.io/paperclipai/paperclip:2026.831.1` and triaging every row (and again
 * on each core bump; entries marked 2026.916 were added for that release).
 *
 * - `ui/src`, `ui/storybook`, `ui/index.html`, `ui/public`, `ui/README.md`,
 *   `ui/package.json`: the board is served from `ui/dist`, which is NOT
 *   allowlisted — a residual there still fails the build.
 * - `server/src`: the CMD runs `server/dist/index.js`.
 * - `cli`: `/app/cli` ships no `dist` (its `bin` points at one), nothing in the
 *   image execs it, and the image exposes `kyoube`, not `paperclipai`.
 * - `doc/plans`, `docs/docs.json`, `docs/images`: upstream's own design plans
 *   and the Mintlify doc-site config/artwork; the product serves neither.
 * - `packages/paperclip-runner/runner`: the Rust crate sources behind the
 *   prebuilt runner binary — compiled upstream, never built here.
 * - `LICENSE`: upstream's copyright notice. Rewriting an attribution would be
 *   a licensing problem, not a branding fix.
 * - `.claude`, `.github`, `design`, `docker`, `evals`, `patches`, `releases`,
 *   `report`, `screenshots`, `scripts`, `tests`, `tools`: upstream's own
 *   development material.
 * - `announcements` (2026.916): the source of upstream's hosted announcement
 *   feed and its examples. The server fetches the feed from
 *   PAPERCLIP_ANNOUNCEMENTS_FEED_URL and never reads this tree, and
 *   docker-compose.yml turns announcements off.
 * - `ui/connect-flow-preview.html`, `ui/connect-model-preview.html` (2026.916):
 *   Vite entry points for upstream's onboarding previews, like `ui/index.html`;
 *   the board is served from `ui/dist`.
 * - `.env.example` (2026.916): upstream's sample environment file; the image
 *   never reads it (KyoubeAI's own is the one in this repository).
 *
 * An entry may be a multi-segment prefix or an exact file path; the longest
 * match names the row a file is counted under, otherwise it is counted under
 * its first path segment (`.` for a file at the root).
