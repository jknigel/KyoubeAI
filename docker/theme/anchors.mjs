/**
 * What theme.css's skin relies on in the core's compiled UI, checked at build
 * time after TEXT_RULES ran.
 *
 * The skin is written to fail safe: every structural rule is gated on the
 * Studio plugin's own markup, and a selector that stops matching just shows
 * the stock look. These checks exist so that a core bump that moves a hook is
 * caught at build time with a named reason, instead of being discovered as a
 * slowly un-themed sidebar.
 *
 * ANCHORS: a literal that must appear at least `min` times in the bundle.
 * SECTIONS: the routes the core's sidebar puts in one section, compared with
 * the set the skin was written for. A section the skin hides must match its
 * set exactly: a new link there would otherwise disappear from the sidebar
 * without a home on the Workspace page.
