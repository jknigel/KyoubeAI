/**
 * Every fix KyoubeAI applies to the upstream core at image build time.
 *
 * This list is meant to be empty. An entry exists only while an upstream bug
 * is fixed here first and the same fix is on its way upstream (`upstream`
 * names the issue or pull request); it is deleted the moment a core bump
 * carries the upstream fix. `apply.mjs` enforces the exit: each pattern must
 * match exactly `expect` times across the files it names, so a core release
 * that no longer has the bug — or that changed the code's shape — fails the
 * build with the patch's id, which is the cue to remove (or redo) it.
 *
 * Patterns are written against the compiled, minified bundle the image ships
 * (`ui/dist`), so they anchor on string literals and code shape, never on
 * minifier-chosen identifier names. See CONTRIBUTING.md, "Never patch the core".

    // the user turn (the "Resume Delta" wake prompt) and each `toolResult`
    // (raw command output) as well as the assistant's own text — and the
    // parser turned all of them into `assistant` transcript entries, so the
    // task chat showed the prompt and every tool output as agent bubbles in
    // the body font (tool output twice: it is also threaded onto its tool
    // card). Only an assistant message may become agent text.
