KyoubeAI is source-available software, licensed under the Business Source License 1.1 in `LICENSE`.
In short, you may read, change and redistribute it, use it for evaluation, development and testing
without limit, and run it in production for up to five users, provided you do not offer it to others
as a hosted, managed or embedded service. Any other production use needs a commercial licence
(https://kyoubeai.com/pricing). Four years after each version is published, that version becomes
available under the Apache License, Version 2.0. `LICENSE` is the binding text, and this summary does
not change it.

KyoubeAI is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind; see `LICENSE`.

## Third-party software

### Paperclip

KyoubeAI builds on Paperclip (https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip), Copyright (c) 2025
Paperclip AI, distributed under the MIT License. The Paperclip image and packages are consumed as
published artifacts; at image build time KyoubeAI applies a branding transform to the image's
user-facing text and artwork (`docker/rebrand/`) and does not otherwise modify them. The MIT
permission notice, reproduced as that licence requires:

> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and
> associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction,
> including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
> sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:
>
> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or

### Agent harnesses installed into the image

The image build (`docker/Dockerfile`) additionally installs third-party agent CLIs that are not part
of this repository and are distributed under their own licences: Claude Code
(`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, Anthropic's licence, see the package's README), pi
(`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) and Hermes Agent (https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).
Their terms apply to those programs, not to KyoubeAI.
